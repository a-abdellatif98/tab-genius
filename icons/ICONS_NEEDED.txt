ICONS NEEDED FOR TAB GENIUS EXTENSION
======================================

This extension requires three icon files to display properly in Chrome:

1. icon16.png  - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon, small)
2. icon48.png  - 48x48 pixels (extensions page)
3. icon128.png - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, large)

QUICK FIX:
----------
You can use any PNG images with these dimensions. Here are some options:

Option 1: Create Simple Icons
- Use any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
- Create 3 PNG files with a simple design (brain emoji, gear, etc.)
- Save them with the names above in this folder

Option 2: Use Online Icon Generator
- Visit: https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
- Create an icon with text "TG" or brain emoji 🧠
- Download and rename the files to match the required names

Option 3: Use Emoji as Icon (Simplest)
- Take a screenshot of the brain emoji 🧠
- Resize to 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 pixels
- Save as PNG files with the required names

Option 4: Download from Icon Sites
- Visit: https://www.flaticon.com/ or https://icons8.com/
- Search for "brain" or "organize" icons
- Download in required sizes

The extension will work fine with simple placeholder icons!
